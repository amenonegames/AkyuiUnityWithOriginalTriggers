## How to use

## Initial setup

- In PackageManager, import the following two items.
  - AkyuiUnity `https://github.com/kyubuns/AkyuiUnity.git?path=Assets/AkyuiUnity`
  - AkyuiUnity.Xd `https://github.com/kyubuns/AkyuiUnity.git?path=Assets/AkyuiUnity.Xd`
- Select Assets > Create > AkyuiXd > XdImportSettings and create a configuration file.
  - By tweaking these settings, you can decide how to import the XD for each project.
  - It has a powerful customization feature called "triggers;" we'll talk about it later.


### How to create an XD file

- The Mark for Export flag in Artboard itself determines which Artboard will be exported.
- Special rules are summarized in [here](https://github.com/kyubuns/AkyuiUnity/blob/main/Manual/Manual_en.md#xd-conversion-rules).
- For features that are not available, see [this section](https://github.com/kyubuns/AkyuiUnity/blob/main/Manual/Manual_en.md#unsupported-item) for functions that cannot be used.


### How to import

- In the Inspector of the XdImportSettings created in "First Time Setup," drag and drop the XD file to the place where it says "Drop xd,"
- After the second time, you can import the file from the history with one button.


### Triggers

- This function allows you to customize how XD files are dropped into Prefab.
- For example, you can set whether to use uGUI's Text or TextMeshPro for text, whether to create a SpriteAtlas, and if so, where to create it.
- The list of triggers is [here](https://github.com/kyubuns/AkyuiUnity/blob/main/Manual/Manual_en.md#trigger-list).


### How to update

- Update the hash in Packages/packages-lock.json.
  - Unity, please prepare a way to update it in a better way.


---
## Xd Import Settings

### Prefab Output Path

- The path to output the Prefab.
- `{name}` will be replaced with the Artboard name.

### Asset Output Directory Path

- The path to the directory containing the images used in the Prefab.
- `{name}` will be replaced with the name of Artboard.

### Meta Output Path

- The path to output Meta files for Prefab.
  - Meta files do not need to be included in the build, but should be saved in a location visible to UnityEditor so that the information can be used when re-importing.
- `{name}` will be replaced with the Artboard name.

### Font Directory Path

- Font directory path to use when creating Prefabs.

### Triggers

### Sprite Save Scale

- Specifies how many times the size of the image used for the Prefab should be saved in XD.
- The larger the size, the larger the Sprite will be and the better it will be saved.

### Reimport Layout

- Reimports the layout of the prefs, even if there are no changes in XD.
  - This is useful if you have changed the settings in XdImportSettings and want them to be reflected.

### Reimport Asset

- Force to reimport the image to be used for the Prefab even if there are no changes in XD.
  - This is useful when you have changed the settings in XdImportSettings and want them to be reflected.

### Object Parsers

### Group Parsers

### Xd Triggers

### Akyui Output Path

- The output path of the Akyui (UI structure definition) file.
- If left blank, it will be invalid.

## Recommended usage

### Prefab handling

- Manually modifying the generated Prefab is not recommended.
  - Changes will be lost when you update XD and import it again.
  - Consider using Triggers if you want to perform specific operations.


### Connecting to [AnKuchen](https://github.com/kyubuns/AnKuchen)

- By using [AnKuchen](https://github.com/kyubuns/AnKuchen), you can easily manipulate the generated UI from a script.
- After importing AnKuchen and generating Prefab, you can use Trigger to give UICacheComponent automatically.

## XD conversion rules

### Naming

If you put the following at the end of the object's name, the component will be pasted on Unity as well.

#### `*Button`

- Button

#### `*Toggle`

- Toggle

#### `*Scrollbar`

- Scrollbar

#### `*Spacer`

- If you put an object named "Spacer" under Scroll, you can specify padding.

#### `*InputField`

- InputField

### Parameters

If you put @~ at the end of the object's name, you can get the following effect.

#### `@Placeholder`

- Do not export the image, only keep the position.

#### `@MultiItems`

- Only valid for Groups with Scroll.
- Expanded elements will be grandchildren instead of children.

#### `@Vector`

- When all children are vector data, import the group as one image into Unity.

#### `@Pivot`

- The center of that object becomes the origin of that group.

#### `@NoSlice`

- disable slice by Auto9Slicer


### Artboard Parameters

If you put @~ at the end of the artboard's name, you can get the following effect.

#### `@Expand`

- Make each object in the root a separate Prefab.

## Unsupported item

### Pending

#### State

- How far and what to reproduce.

#### Shadow

#### Blur

### No plan

#### Angular Gradient

- I don't do SVG output from XD because it's not supported.

#### 3D Transforms

- Unity can reproduce this, but I don't want to put it in Akyui, so I won't do it.

#### Blend Mode

- I can't think of a generic way to reproduce this in Unity, so I won't do it.
